\begin_layout Title
Structure Based Classification of Webpages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Given, a large set of web pages in the retail domain, our aim is to classify
 them into Product Pages, Product Listing Pages and Irrelevant Pages.
 We had earlier proposed a multilevel classification scheme for the same,
 where we attempt to classify based on the less informative parts of the
 web page, and if unsuccessful, start looking at the page content.
 The scope of this report, is restricted to the latter, where we classify
 based on the web page content only.
 Also, we focus on the elimination of irrelevant pages, by constructing
 one-class Support Vector Machine classifiers on the Product page and Listing
 page data.
 This can be viewed as a 
\shape italic
Novelty Detection Problem
\shape default
, where the irrelevant pages do not have any model for themselves, but are
 treated as outliers or abnormalties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One Class Support Vector Machines was first proposed by Sch√∂lkopf et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "a"

\end_inset

.
 This method constructs a function, that is positive for a small subset
 of the data and negative everywhere else.
 This can be visualized, as a small ball or hypersphere around the positive
 class, separating them from the negative class.
 This is particularly useful when the negative class is extremely large,
 compared to the positive data or when it is not possible to generate sufficient
 data for one of the two classes to train a binary classifier.
 In our problem, the irrelevant pages are the negative pages.
 They include all webpages that are not product or product listing pages,
 which is massive compared to the positive class.
 Training a model, that captures features of all such pages is almost impossible.
 Hence, they are treated as outliers and the problem itself is reduced to
 a Novelty Detection Problem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data used for training consisted of 2875 webpages, out of which 1433
 were product pages and the remaining 1442 were product listing pages.
 These were obtained from around 300 different retailers.
 Also for testing, 50 different irrelevant pages were obtained from popular
 retail websites like flipkart, amazon and ebay.
 These included pages such as user information pages, career pages, shipping
 rates, policies, press releases etc.
 Natural Language Toolkit was used for extracting the features and Scikit
 Learn package, based on LIBSVM 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "c"

\end_inset

 was used for training the one-class SVM on the product and product listing
 pages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The entire webpage classification process can be divided into the following
 four stages: 
\emph on
Document-Vector matrix creation, feature extraction, training classifiers
 on the reduced data, testing on new data.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Document-Vector model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Document-Vector model is used to represent the presence or frequency of
 words in a set of documents.
 It is called bag-of-words representation, where the rows of a matrix represent
 a document, and the columns represent the words in the document.
 The cell values can be either 0/1 indicating absence or presence of words
 in documents or they can also hold the frequency of words in documents.
 In this experiment, we use the 0/1 based bag of words model, where each
 row represents a unique web page and the columns represent the words in
 the webpages.
 Thus, we generate two sets of document-vector matrices: one for the product
 pages and one for product-listing pages.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Feature Extraction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a html document features can be of two types: 
\shape italic
Text Features,
\shape default
 captured by the bag of words model, and 
\shape italic
Structural Features
\shape default
.
 The structural features themselves, might not carry much information about
 the webpage.
 However, when combined with the text features,they are expected to improve
 the results.
 At present, the focus is on text features only.
 However, in future, ways to combine both these sets of features and train
 the model on the combined feature set will be explored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The html document may contain stop words, punctuation marks, digits and
 empty spaces, which do not contribute to the classification.
 Hence, it is necessary to remove features corresponding to these, while
 vectorizing the document.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Training and Testing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first matrix will have 1483 rows, corresponding to 1433 product pages
 and 50 test pages and the second matrix will contain 1492 rows, corresponding
 to 1442 listing pages and the same 50 webpages.
 For training the product pages model, we took out 133 product pages and
 used them as test data along with the generated test pages.
 Similarly, for the listing pages 150 were taken out for testing.
 It is necessary to shuffle the pages, before taking out the test pages,
 so as to have a mix of all retailers in the training data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One class SVMs using Radial Basis Function kernel
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "b"

\end_inset

, were trained on these two datasets.
 Model parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 were varied and the models generated were tried on the test data taken
 out.
 Since, we need to minimize both false positives and false negatives, the
 model with the highest f-measure was considered as the best model and its
 results are shown below.

Conclusions and Future Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The classifiers developed are adequate for eliminating irrelevant webpages.
 However, the biggest challenge is develop a classifier that will differentiate
 between product webpages and product-listing webpages.
 There is a large overlap between the two classes, as the product listing
 pages themselves may contain descriptions of a number of products.
 Hence, content specific features alone are not sufficient to differentiate
 between the two classes.
 We need to extract features that carry information about the structure
 of the webpages.
 One such approach would be, to use the html tag distribution by calculating
 the tag to text ratio in web pages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, the multilevel scheme of classification also needs to be implemente
d.
 Along with a series of classifiers at each level, we also need to develop
 a confidence measure that indicates the efficiency of classification at
 each level.
 On close examination of the webpage URLs, one can be assured that this
 will produce good results for a good percentage of product and listing
 pages, as the URLs themeselves carry text with sufficient discriminating
 power.
 For example, many of the product page URLs will have the text 'productId='
 in the URL.
 Similarly, many product listing pages have 'categoryId' in their URLs.
 The confidence measure should be sufficiently high for such classifications.
